Basic recipe website

This task is to code a simple recipe website.  I will be using the knowledge I learned
about HTML including links, lists, images, headers, paragraphs and some other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting.  I personally think it wont be too difficult and take around an hour or two depending on the requirements that I haven't read yet but I also think there's a very high chance I'm humbled.  It's 3:02 PM on 2/27/22 right now and I'm going to start.

Finished at 4:01 with a 5 minute hamster break.  Was quite easy so far but I'm just getting my feet wet.  It was really fun.  I think I probably could have done this in half the time if I used the ! command for the boilerplates and copied and pasted my own code three times, but for the sake of practice I wrote them all from scratch.
