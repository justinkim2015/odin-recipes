Basic recipe website

This task is to code a simple recipe website.  I will be using the knowledge I learned
about HTML including links, lists, images, headers, paragraphs and some other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting.  I personally think it wont be too difficult and take around an hour or two depending on the requirements that I haven't read yet but I also think there's a very high chance I'm humbled.  It's 3:02 PM on 2/27/22 right now and I'm going to start.
