        <h2 class="head subhead">Description</h2>

            <p class="body">The BEST Garlic Shrimp ever! Itâ€™s just like the famous shrimp you buy at 
             the food trucks in Hawaii. Made with succulent shrimp cooked in an extra 
             garlicky, deliciously rich, butter based sauce.</p>
 
        <h2 class="head subhead">Ingredients</h2>   

          <ul>
             <li>1 lb. extra large shrimp</li>
             <li>1/4 cup minced fresh garlic</li>
             <li>1 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
             <li>1 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
             <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
             <li>6 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
             <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
             <li>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
             <li>1 Tbsp minced fresh parsley</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h2 class="head subhead">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using paper towels, dab shrimp dry of excess moisture on both sides. Place in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt and pepper as desired. Toss to evenly coat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large 12-inch non-stick skillet.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and saute 30 seconds until nicely fragrant (but not browning!).</li>
                <li>Add shrimp in an even layer in skillet. Cook on first side until pinkish color on bottom, about 2 minutes. Then flip and cook opposite side until just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, toss with lemon and garnish with parsley if using.</li>
                <li>Serve right away topped with extra garlic butter sauce from pan.</li>
            </ol>
