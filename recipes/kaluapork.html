        <h2 class="head subhead">Description</h2>
            <p>Kalua pork is a smoked shredded meat. It is the main dish and most common food served at traditional Hawaiian luaus and feasts.</p>

        <h2 class="head subhead">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 lbs. bone-in pork shoulder</li>
                <li>1 1/2 Tbsp natural liquid smoke flavor</li>
                <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Hawaiian salt, Himalayan salt</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="head subhead">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If time allows, heat 1 Tbsp vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Dab roast dry with paper towels then sear in pot for about 3 minutes per side to brown</li>
                <li>Place pork in 6 or 7 quart slow cooker. Drizzle liquid smoke over both sides.</li>
                <li>Season both sides with salt.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook on low heat 14 - 16 hours until incredibly tender.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a cutting board (reserve liquid in slow cooker), shred pork with two forks while removing bone and excess fat.</li>
                <li>If desired toss pork with about 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid (rendered broth and fat from pork).</li>
                <li>Serve right away, or refrigerate in reserved liquid for a few days or freeze in reserved liquid for a few months. Thaw overnight and reheat over low heat in a pot on stovetop, tossing gently just occasionally, until heated through.</li>
            </ol>
